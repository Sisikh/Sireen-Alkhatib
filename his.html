<h3>Early Years (1800s-1900s)</h3>

The concept of luxury hotels dates back to the early 19th century. In the 1820s, the first grand hotels were built in Europe, such as the Grand HÃ´tel in Paris and the Savoy Hotel in London. These hotels catered to wealthy travelers and offered luxurious amenities like fine dining, comfortable rooms, and elegant lobbies.

<h3>Golden Age (1900s-1950s)</h3>

The early 20th century saw the rise of iconic 5-star hotels like the Ritz Paris (1898), the Plaza Hotel in New York City (1907), and the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco (1907). These hotels were renowned for their opulence, fine dining, and exceptional service. The Golden Age of hotel luxury continued until the mid-20th century, when travel became more accessible to the masses.

<h3>Modern Era (1950s-Present)</h3>

The post-war era saw the rise of international hotel chains like Hilton (1946), Marriott (1957), and InterContinental (1953). These chains introduced standardized amenities and services across their properties, making luxury travel more accessible and consistent. The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of boutique hotels and design-driven luxury hotels, such as the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston (1970) and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong (1963).

<h3>Contemporary Era (2000s-Present)</h3>

In recent years, luxury hotels have continued to evolve with new technologies, sustainable practices, and innovative design concepts. Some notable trends include:
